The Central Asia and Mongolia Gender Data Portal (CAMGDP) is a resource created by the Rutgers University - New Brunswick Libraries to assist scholars, academics, activists, and students in finding gender-related data on Central Asia and Mongolia. We compile quantitative and qualitative sources, informational websites, media publications, and various level organizations that work in Kazakhstan. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia. Our focus on gendered data comes from personal research interests and observations of the lack of gender-related data portals on Central Asia and Mongolia.
