## International non-governmental organizations (INGOs)
Official international sources ([INGOs](/category/ingo)) cover gender issues in Kazakhstan using a comparative perspective that applies standardized reporting methods to Kazakhstan.  These can be good sources of numeric data at the country-level.  For example, see the 
[UN Population Fund in Kazakhstan](/sources/sources/un_population_fund_kazakhstan/) or the [World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report](/sources/sources/wef_global_gender_gap_report/).

Other INGOs take a more focused, activist perspective, such as the [Spotlight Initiative Regional Programme for Central Asia and Afghanistan](/sources/sources/spotlight_initiative).

## Local non-governmental organizations (Local NGOs)

For information on issues that often go unrecognized in official state media and governmental sources, such as feminist activism and LGBTQ topics, [local NGOs](/category/local-ngo) can fill in the gaps.  For example, see [Feminita](/sources/sources/feminita/), a grassroots queer feminist collective, and the grassroots feminist organization [KazFem](/sources/sources/kazfem/).

## Government

Kazakh [Government](/category/government) resources provide many official data series (such as the [Bureau of National Statistics Gender Statistics](/sources/sources/bureau_of_national_statistics_gender/)) and sources of official government laws and pronouncements (such as [Ak Orda](/sources/sources/ak_orda/)), but may lack in coverage of underrepresented groups or controversial issues.

## Media

While [state-affiliated media](/category/state-affiliated-media/) (see [Zakon.kz](/sources/sources/zakon_kz/) offer mainstream perspectives, [independent media](/category/independent-media/) can deliver alternative viewpoints.  For example,  [Batyr Jamal](/sources/sources/batyr_jamal/) takes a women-oriented perspective, while [Human Rights KZ](/sources/sources/human_rights_kz/) highlights human rights concerns. 

## Local information 

Regional and information on areas within Kazakhstan is sparser, but local government offices represent one source of information.

### Nur-Sultan (Astana)

Information and data on the capital, now renamed Nur-Sultan from Astana, is available from the [Akimat of the city of Nur-Sultan](/sources/sources/akimat_of_the_city_of_nur_sultan/).

### Almaty

The [Akimat of the city of Almaty](/sources/sources/akimat_of_the_city_of_almaty/) provides information on the largest city in Kazakhstan.
