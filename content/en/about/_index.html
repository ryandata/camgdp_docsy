<h1 class="text-center">About</h1>

The Central Asia and Mongolia Gender Data Portal (CAMGDP) is a data portal created by the Rutgers University - New Brunswick Libraries to assist scholars, academics, activists, and students in finding gender-related data on Central Asia and Mongolia. We compile quantitative and qualitative sources, informational websites, media publications, and various level organizations that work in Kazakhstan. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia. Our focus on gendered data comes from personal research interests and observations of the lack of gender-related data portals on Central Asia and Mongolia.
Gender-related data can look many different ways. It is primarily related to the rights and affairs of women and children, as well as the LGBTQ+ community. Just like in the real world, no social issue is devoid of the gendered aspect, which is why we include sources that may not have gender as their primary focus but that do engage with the gendered aspect in their work. We include not only quantitative datasets and published reports but narratives, oral histories, local discourses, storytelling, and other important types of references. While we roughly divide the sources into quantitative and qualitative, we understand that many sources fall outside of this binary or are located at the intersection of both. 

The data is divided into various sections, as well as by each country. International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs) section includes international organizations and institutions that engage in some form of gender-related data reporting on the region. These are organizations founded and based outside of Central Asia and Mongolia. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) section includes both regional and country specific organizations that represent grassroots efforts and local initiatives related to gender issues. This section includes Central Asian regional organizations, as well as smaller local activist efforts. While organizations in this section may receive funding and support from international and foreign institutions, they are primary located in Central Asia and/or Mongolia and their work primarily concerns Central Asian countries and/or Mongolia. Government section includes official databases, publications, and press centers. Independent and international media section includes media sources with a track record of reliable and fact-checked reporting and journalistic writing. This section consists of both Central Asian or Mongolia-based publications and foreign publications that regularly cover the region. State-affiliated media includes publications that have been linked to a state apparatus or that are state-owned. Relevant tags are provided for each data source for easier website navigation.

<h1 class="text-center">Mission Statement</h1>
Given the rising interest in the region, our goal is to provide a guide to everyone committed to a non-violent knowledge production on Central Asia and Mongolia. We aim to not only comprise a list of sources as a starting point for oneâ€™s research but to assist in critical analysis of the gender-related data and publications available on Central Asia and Mongolia. While INGOs and their contribution are important, our portal prioritizes local initiatives and grassroots organizations in an effort to give them the same credit and exposure as their international and foreign counterparts often receive in Western scholarship and media. By creating a comprehensive data portal with relevant reflections, remarks, and facts, we hope to help researchers find local, regional, and international initiatives, publications, and secondary sources and engage in a more horizontal work with Central Asian and Mongolian communities.
