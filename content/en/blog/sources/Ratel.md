Founded in 2013, [Ratel](https://ratel.kz/) offers coverage of current events, opinion pieces, and journalistic investigations in Kazakhstan, specifically concerning corruption. The publication had its license rescinded in 2018 in a court ruling on the grounds of spreading misinformation due to the published investigations of various corruption cases. The site resumed its work in 2019. Available primarily in Russian with occasional publications in Kazakh and English.
