Kazakhstan is not a member of the OECD and acts as its [partner for the Eurasian region] (https://www.oecd.org/countries/kazakhstan/). 

Out of available data on Kazakhstan found on the OECD portal, the [2017 Gender Policy Delivery in Kazakhstan review] (https://www.oecd.org/countries/kazakhstan/gender-policy-delivery-in-kazakhstan-9789264280359-en.htm) is so far the only gender-related publication on Kazakhstan. 

The review contains policy assessment and recommendation. Methodological note and information on data collection are not available.
