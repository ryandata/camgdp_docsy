[Bureau of National Statistics / Gender] (https://gender.stat.gov.kz/en) is the official government resource representing a collection of gendered data on population, family, healthcare, education and communication, employment, human rights, and politics. The Bureau has received criticism of its data from a feminist organization [Kaz Fem] (https://www.instagram.com/p/CUmGoyNsJPu/). Kaz Fem created [its own alternative platform] (https://schitaetsya.kz/) about the domestic violence situation in Kazakhstan.
