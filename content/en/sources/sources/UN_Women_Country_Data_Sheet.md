The [UN Women Country Data Sheet](https://data.unwomen.org/) offers country specific gender-related data across four main components: economic, social, political, and environmental. Data sheets are available for [Kazakhstan](https://data.unwomen.org/country/kazakhstan), [Kyrgyzstan](https://data.unwomen.org/country/kyrgyzstan), [Mongolia](https://data.unwomen.org/country/mongolia), [Tajikistan](https://data.unwomen.org/country/tajikistan), [Turkmenistan](https://data.unwomen.org/country/turkmenistan), and [Uzbekistan](https://data.unwomen.org/country/uzbekistan),. Some of the economic data is missing, while environmental data does not include a gender-based breakdown. Gender-specific indicators have at least 50% of data missing across the 17 indicators listed. 

Methodological note and information on data collection is [available here](https://data.unwomen.org/modules/custom/country_fact_sheet/pdf/MethodologicalNote.pdf).
