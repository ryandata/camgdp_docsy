Founded in 2013, [Trans*Coalition](https://www.transcoalition.net/) is a platform for trans- and non-binary activists from the countries of the Caucasus, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It advocates for uniting, solidarizing, strengthening the voice of the trans-activist community in our region through the development of a sustainable, effective, authoritative, and resourceful organization. Key areas of Trans*Coalition's work include response to the COVID-19 pandemic, migration, depathologizing, sex work, and legislation. In Central Asia, Trans*Coalition offers a hot line, a map of resources and aid, and information for trans sex workers.
