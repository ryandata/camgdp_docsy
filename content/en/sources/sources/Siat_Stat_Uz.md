The [SIAT Integrated Information System](https://siat.stat.uz) provides detailed statistical tables for economic and social indicators for the Republic of Uzbekistan.

After selecting the desired indicator, data may be downloaded in Excel, CSV, PDF, JSON, or XML formats, and may also be graphed online, with downloadable images.  Either time series line charts or cartograms can be selected. Detailed metadata describes the provenance of the data and contacts for further information.

The site is navigable in Uzbek, Russian, and English. Most downloads of publications and tables are in Russian.
