Founded in 1998, the [Republic of Kazakhstan Administrations of Internal Affairs’ Units to Guard Women against Violence](https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V1500012948) is a domestic body on the basis of police work force designed to protect constitutional rights of women, coordinate detention and prosecution processes in the case of the detention of women, and organize work to prevent domestic violence against women. The official text of the establishment of the units [could be found here](https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V1500012948). In 2021, Kaz Fem feminist organization [criticized](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXtA7T6MbAM/) the compensation policy of the Units’ workers stating that on average its female workers earn less than workers of other internal affairs’ units.
