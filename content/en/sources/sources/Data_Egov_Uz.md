  The Open Data Portal of the Republic of Uzbekistan provides access to over 10,000 datasets on various aspects of the country
---

The [Open Data Portal of the Republic of Uzbekistan](https://data.egov.uz) provides over 10,000 freely downloadable datasets from more than 150 organizations on various aspects of life in Uzbekistan, including education, health, economy, population, culture, justice, and more.

Datasets are typically available in CSV, Excel, XML, JSON, and RDF formats. Before downloading, a brief pop-up will ask the user to identify the intended use of the data (research, personal, application development, media, or other), but no registration is required.  In addition to keyword search, data can be browsed by topic or organization, and the most recent and most highly rated datasets are highlighted.

The site is navigable in Uzbek, Russian, and English.
