The [Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/lsms) is the World Bank's flagship household survey program focused on strengthening household survey systems in client countries and on improving the quality of microdata to better inform development policies. The LSMS is housed in the Data Production and Methods Unit of the World Bankâ€™s Development Data Group.

[Data on Kyrgyzstan](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/lsms/?page=1&country%5B%5D=118&ps=15&repo=lsms) is available from 1993 to 1998 through the **Poverty Monitoring Survey**.

The scope of the study includes household and family, jobs and employment, education, health, and other variables.
