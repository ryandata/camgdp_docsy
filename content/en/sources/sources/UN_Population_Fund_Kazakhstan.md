The [UN Population Fund](https://www.unfpa.org) produces country-specific landing pages. The work of the Fund includes data on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality, young people, and population matters.

Their [Data Portal for Kazakhstan](https://www.unfpa.org/data/world-population/KZ) gender-related data across six main components: population, sexual and reproductive health, family planning, education, gender, rights, and human capital, and harmful practices.   Their semi-regularly published [reports and surveys](https://kazakhstan.unfpa.org/en/publications) address these topics. Survey publcations contain a methodology section.

There is also a [Transparency portal](https://www.unfpa.org/data/transparency-portal/unfpa-kazakhstan) that details expenses and program activities of the Population Fund in Kazakhstan.

Methodological note and information on data collection are not available.
