[Bahor/Vesna](facebook.com/people/Bahor-Весна/) is a self-organized group of cultural immigrant-workers from Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine who have migrated to Uzbekistan following the escalation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The initiative covers educational and cultural events in Uzbekistan. Bahor/Vesna is described as a project born out of necessity to "find connections during the tragic events affecting millions of residents in Ukraine, Russia, and other countries." The initiative mostly focuses on music and contemporary art, as well as cinematography, literature, and research. It has presence on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bahorvesnaa/), [Telegram](https://t.me/bahorvesna), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8YmBSTfITo0VZ9zZkG6ShQ).
