[Qizlar](https://www.instagram.com/qizlarqizlarqizlar/) is an independent collective of women-creators from Uzbekistan. The collective's mission is described as spotlighting projects and products created by women and non-binary people, as well as fostering safe and friendly space for minorities. Qizlar also works on projects with a decolonial agenda aimed at "understanding and working out identities as a product of complex post-colonial processes."
