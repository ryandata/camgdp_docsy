Founded in 2005 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the [Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project](https://www.occrp.org/) aims to develop and equip a global network of investigative journalists, as well as publish stories exposing crime and corruption. The project regularly covers post-Soviet and Central Asian countries.
