Founded in 2022, [Stop Harass](https://stopharass.kz/) is a Kazakhstani harassment prevention and tracking website. Its mission is to "engage all residents of Kazakhstan in creating an environment that is intolerant of sexual assault, harassment, stalking, catcalling, etc." The platform allows anyone to report harassment instances either via Telegram bot or website.
