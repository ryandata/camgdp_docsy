[Gender Statistics](https://gender.stat.uz/) of the [National Statistics Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan](https://stat.uz) provides highlighted gender indicators on education, fertility, health, labor and employment, and more. These are downloadable in multiple formats (Excel,CSV, PDF, JSON, XML), with dates of coverage typically from the 2000s to the present. The publication [Women and Men in Uzbekistan: Facts and Figures](https://gender.stat.uz/en/2020-11-09-06-11-08/women-var-men-in-uzbekistan-facts-and-figures) is also available here.

In the words of the site, "Gender statistics are statistics that adequately reflect the real situation of women and men in all strategic areas in order to identify gender differences and study them systematically."

The mission of the site is described as follows:
"Gender statistics serve many purposes, but first of all, they are needed to detect hidden problems concerning the conditions and different status of women and men. In this regard, gender statistics are essential for successful planning, targeting, effective monitoring and evaluation of the impact of development programmes. Thus, gender statistics are a tool for promoting justice and equality, as well as improving the quality of life of all population groups. Gender statistics contribute to achieving sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development."

"This site is the first attempt to create an electronic database of gender statistics with the aim of further improving gender-related information, regular and timely release of gender-disaggregated data. It takes into account the recommendations of international organizations in the direction of systematization, introduction and development of new indicators that allow for a comparative analysis of the status of women and men in society. This work is carried out as part of the development of all branches of national statistics, aimed at adequately reflecting new aspects of the country's socio-economic development, due to the deepening of reforms and democratization of society."

The site is navigable in Uzbek, Russian, and English.  The [Gender Equality Achievement Strategy Indicators](https://gender.stat.uz/uz/gender-2030) (Gender Tenglikka Erishish Strategiyasi Koâ€˜rsatkichlar) are available only in Uzbek.
